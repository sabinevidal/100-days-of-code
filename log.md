# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 43: November 13

**Today:** Learnt about Variables and Types in Swift on Swift Playground. Started Harvard's CS50x course and listened to the week 0 computational lecture. Pset0 was in Scratch and we had to create something on it while meeting requirements. I created a chase and avoid game where a dinosaur chased white jellyfish and ate them, and had to avoid red jellyfish or they'd die. Also solved a problem with the Wordpress portfolio I'm working on where I wasn't sure how to call custom post types. 

**Thoughts:** Got frustrated with Types in Swift, understood what I was supposed to do, but just took a while to write everything down. Think I was also just excited to get started with CS50! I really enjoyed the first lecture - David Malan has a great stage presence. He made abstraction, binary code and computational thinking in general relevant and easy to understand. Scratch was a great place to start with programming, and I really enjoyed the PSet. I was inspired by a Neopets game, and felt quite empowered when I could look at a game I played as a kid and be able to decompose it and recreate it (kind of). I struggled with some of the stuff though at the end, with trying to get the game how to stop (see below). But managed to finish it and am happy with how it turned out! 

I wanted to call some CPT posts into the 404 page of the portfolio site, but was unsure how to do this at first, but got it working (see below) after searching good old Stack Overflow. 

**Learning Opportunities:** I wanted to clean up my code in Scratch, so tried to use operators to join the jellyfish objects in an if statement resulting in them either killing the dinosaur or being eaten themselves and the dinosaur scoring a point. I started with this (in pseudocode-ish):

		`if touching jellyfish1 or jellyfish2 or jellyfish3
			then win a point
			jellyfish disappears
			if score = 3 then game ends`
			

This resulted in the game ending when the first jellyfish was caught. I changed the `or` to `and`, but nothing happened (because obviouslt this meant the dino had to be touching all the jellyfish at the same time for anything to happen. I went back to the original long form where each jellyfish was under its own `if` statement. Which worked! Definitely got a firmer understanding of how literal operators can be. 

Then for calling CPTs onto a page I found this solution:

		`<?php $loop = new WP_Query( array( 'post_type' => 'custom_post_type', 'posts_per_page' => 10 ) ); ?>
				<?php while ( $loop->have_posts() ) : $loop->the_post(); ?>
						<?php the_title( '<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="' . get_permalink() . '" title="' . the_title_attribute( 'echo=0' ) . '" rel="bookmark">', '</a></h2>' ); ?>
								<div class="entry-content">
										<?php the_content(); ?>
								</div>
				<?php endwhile; ?>` 
		
Just have to edit `'custom_post_type'` to the CPT used, add `<ul></ul>` around `<?php the_title`, change `h2` to `li`, and delete `the_content` to create a ul list instead of a ‘blogroll’

### Day 44: November 14

**Today:** Read some articles and carried on fiddling around with the portfolio site, fixing up 404 page, footer and the header. 

**Thoughts:** Spent the day thinking about CS50, and had planned to listen to the next lecture, but was preoccupied with finishing this portfolio, as the deadline is soon. Mostly just design fiddles, working out what looked good, and how to make it accessible. 

**Learning Opportunities:** Wanted to include a gallery on the 404 page, so created a new widget sidebar just for the page. Took some fiddling to work out where to place it on the 404.php page so it floated to the right place as a sidebar and collapsed with the media queries (outside the content-area, which was obvious as soon as I looked at another page with a sidebar. Used this code which I copied from the custom widget areas in the footer: 
 
 		`<div id="error-sidebar" class="widget-area">
          <?php
            if(is_active_sidebar('error-sidebar')){
            dynamic_sidebar('error-sidebar');
            }
        	?>
			</div>'
		
Then wanted an image to replace the site title generated by WP (while still keeping the site title code there for screen readers/accessibility. Turned off 'show site title and tagline' in WP admin, and then added the following code inside the .site-branding div but outside the php loop:

	`<div id="header-image" >
	 	<a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>" title="<?php echo esc_attr( get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ) ); ?>" rel="home">
			<img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/inc/emilie-name.png" alt="Logo" width="HERE" height="HERE" />
		</a> 	
		</div>`

Then just fiddle with CSS. Made the mistake of giving it the same class as the site title (.site-title), which hid the image because obviously WP admin uses this class to hide the site title when needed. Thanks dev tools!

### Day 45: November 15

**Today:** Played on Playgrounds, learnt about initialisation and parameters. Listened to CS50 week1 lecture on C, and got through one fo the shorts on data types too. 

**Thoughts:** Excited to get a bit further with Swift Playgrounds, I'm enjoying being able to incrementally see each skill I'm picking up, and being able to practice the older ones. Not sure what it is about this format, but it works for me. And it's so exciting to see how much more comfortable I am with the older skills already, where I don't have to think about how to use conditionals or loops. Really enjoying Swift and it's syntax, and looking forward to using it in a proper project soon. 

It's very interesting to be learning C at the same time as Swift. The format of Playgrounds is helping me understand programming syntax and how to think about things computationally, and C and the CS50 lectures give me a base of the _HOW_ Swift works and is put together. You can see C is an older language and requires so much more. Im curious to get started with the pset and see how I fare... I think I understand what's happening, but we all know that can change when I actually try _DO_. 

**Learning Opportunities:** Just some algorithm ordering in Swift that I struggled with in the exercise 'Generalizing a function'. I needed to set the parameters for the function of turning the lock up or down. I tried: 

`func turnLock (up:Bool, numberOfTimes: int)
	{
		for i in 1 ... numberOfTimes {
			if true {
				expert.turnLockUp() }
			else { 
				expert.turnLockDown() }
		}
	}`
	

That did not work. The character just kept on turning it up. Fiddled around and finally just looked it up to get an idea of where I was going wrong. Thank goodness for [Building Rainbows!](https://buildingrainbows.com)
Actually meant to be:
`func turnLock (up:Bool, numberOfTimes: int)
	{
		if up == true {
			for i in 1 ... numberOfTimes {
				expert.turnLockUp() }
		} else {
			for i in 1 ... numberOfTimes {
				expert.turnLockDown() }
		}
	}`
	
Realised I needed to determine the value of `up` before calling `for`, as my first attempt was basically just running through the `if` `else` statements a number of times, not running the command of turning the lock the number of times needed.

### Day 46: November 16

**Today:** Just finished off portfolio, had to fiddle around with final CSS stylings, getting the correct header image and cleaning up everything. Struggled with getting this live, as at first I couldn't login to the database, and after couldn't log into the wp-admin. 

**Thoughts:** I've enjoyed putting this together, especially giving more thought about how someone else will use it and how accessible it is for them to add their own stuff and edit what they need to/want to. I think when working with Wordpress one has to be more aware of how someone else might want to edit your work, eg change colours or layouts, and finding a balance between making it easy for the client, but also making sure they can't break anything. 

**Learning Opportunities:** Figured that I could create some 'custom css' in the wp-admin for the client to be able to change the feature colour. It is a yellow at the moment, but they're likely going to change that depending on what they upload. Simple as putting the specific class with styling for the colour in the custom css box under the appearance>customiser tool and leaving instructions on how to change it with the client.

No fix on getting the portfolio live. Left it for tomorrow as I was focusing on life for today.

### Day 47: November 17

**Today:** Today was all about getting the portfolio live and tackling CS50s pset 1.1 (Mario less). Also got through some of w1's shorts explaining conditionals and loops in C. Really struggled with the pset and had to search around a lot for something that made it make sense to me. I'm very much a deep _how_ and _why_ thinker/understander. I need to know it all before I can accept and understand it. Took me at least 4 hours (over about 8 hours) to get it working. 

**Thoughts:** I watched the pset shorts mostly to just help with the pset. But they're really good for solidifying everything and getting some extra info. C is a weird language. Just as I think I understand it, I look at a `for` loop and get lost. Definitely needed a bit extra time to wrap my head around how the loops were written out and how they worked. I get the basics of it, and can easily do it in Swift now, but C feels clunky (for want of a better word). Totally understand why they teach it though! Once I understood it, I felt like I had a much deeper grasp of what it was doing, and felt like I could look at other languages and translate it into them (well... we'll see I guess). 

**Learning Opportunities:** 
So here's the final Mario (less) answer, mostly so I can look back on it... 
	`int main(void)
	{
	    int height; 

	    //get user input
	    do 
	    { 
		height = get_int("Height:");
	    }
	    while (height < 1 || height > 8);

	    //build pyramid
	    if (height > 0 || height < 9) 
	    {
		for (int h = 0; h < height; h++)
		{
		    //loop for spaces 
		    for (int sp = height - h; sp > 1; sp--) 
		    {
			printf(" ");
		    }
		    //loop for hashes
		    for (int ha = 0; ha <= h; ha++) 
		    {
			printf("#");
		    }
		    //new line after each iteration
		    printf("\n");
		}
	    }
	}
`

Initially I put 
	`//loop for spaces 
		for (int sp = height - h; sp > 0; sp--)`
which resulted in my checks failing, even though it all looked correct at first glance. When I investigated, it seemed it was printing an extra space in front of the hash, `" #"` instead of `"#"`. This is because, by having `sp > 0`, spaces were being input from row 0 (ie row 1 in CS talk), where actually one didn't want any spaces. They should've been starting from second row, which is achieved by checking the boolean expression between the two semicolons. `sp > 0` translates to "is the integer greater than 0", but because the height is starting from 1, then this is always going to be true. When I changed it to `sp > 1`, it translated to "is the integer greater than 1", so the first row (height = 1) would come back as false, and therefore no space would be printed.

To fix the portfolio I just deleted the wordpress install off the domain and literally uploaded the entire wordpress install + theme files from my localhost using Dreamhost's WebFTP.
